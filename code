# Problem 1: Use a for statement and random.randrange to print 10 random integers between 25 and 35.

# Below I created a for loop with the loop variable rand. I then set the range of iterations to 10
# I then created a variable named random_int with a value that gets a random number within the range of 25 and 35
# Lastly I added a print function for the random_int variable. This prints a random integer within the range of 25 and 35 ten times.

for rand in range(10):
    random_int = random.randrange(25, 36) # Inclusive
    print(random_int)



import random

# Problem 2: Use random.randrange to print an odd integer between 0 and 100.
# In the code below I created a variable named random_odd that genearates a random odd number using random.randrage
# Lastly I added the random_odd variable to print a single psuedo random odd number 

random_odd = random.randrange(1, 101, 2)  # Generates a random odd number between 1 and 100
print(random_odd)



import random

# Problem 3: Use random.choice to select a day of the week from a list and print that day.

days = ["Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"] # Creates a list with all days inside

random_day = random.choice(days) # Here I created a varaible with the value of random.choice(days). This will generate a random day from the days list above.
print(random_day) # This will print the random_day variable with the value of the random day that is generated.
